## Why a printer?

3d printers are one of the most modern technologies that i believe should be accessible for everyone. It is what of the few things I use on a daily basis to help me prototype, iterate, and finalize designs.
Additionally, I also wanted to use this project as an opportunity to help me sharpen my CAD, electronic, and coding skills.
The end goal is to build a functional, compact 3d printer that also produces solid quality prints.
